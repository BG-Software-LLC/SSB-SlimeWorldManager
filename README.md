# SSB-SlimeWorldManager
SSB-SlimeWorldManager is an addon that adds support for SlimeWorldManager (or AdvancedSlimeWorldManager) with SuperiorSkyblock2.
When installed, each island will have its own "slime world" that is handled by SWM/ASWM. Depending on your server's version, you
will either use SWM (for versions 1.8 and 1.12) or ASWM (for versions 1.18 & 1.19).

To use this addon, download the latest version of the addon and drop it inside the **modules** folder, which is located inside the **SuperiorSkyblock2**
folder. Make sure that you have the latest dev version of SuperiorSkyblock2 and the latest version of SWM/ASWM (the latest version of ASWM
can be found in their discord server under the #new-builds channel).

When installed, each island will have its own world that is handled by SWM/ASWM. You can configure the datasource to which the world is saved
to under the module's configuration file, as well as the amount of time until an island is unloaded after not being used.
